You have to develop a flutter app containing a single workflow for ordering food from local restaurants similar to popular food delivery apps.

Here are some of the guidelines for developing the workflow:

1. You should use the BloC architecture for state management

2. You should make the steps in the workflow as realistic as possible.

3. The workflow should have proper error handling mechanisms.

4. There is no need for login or any other screens. Only the workflow is required.

5. You should use aesthetically pleasing design elements to make your assignment stand out.

6. You should architect and structure the code with proper SOLID principles.

7. Unit Tests for the workflow should be present.

Once it is ready, you should upload your code to github and share the github repository link here. Your repository should contain a README file containing a screenshot of your app and instructions on how to run it.

API Integration is not needed. Use mock data and any standard design
